# Learning-Neural-Surface-Representations
This is the code base for my Master's Theses titled "Learning Neural Surface Representations from Prominent Objects in Video Sequences" which I did under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. RÃ¼diger Westermann](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/cg/people/westermann/) at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). [Christian Reinbold](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/cg/people/reinbold/) was my advisor for the thesis. You can find a pdf copy of the thesis in this repo.

The code is not properly organized yet and will require some effort to get it running. The following are the bare minimum required to get the repo running:

1. [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/)
2. [MiVOS](https://github.com/hkchengrex/MiVOS/tree/MiVOS-STCN)
3. [IDR](https://github.com/lioryariv/idr)

In addition, some parts of the repo use the followings:

1. [Mask-RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN)
2. [LDSO](https://github.com/tum-vision/LDSO)
3. [RVOS](https://github.com/imatge-upc/rvos)
4. [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
5. [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin)
6. [DVR](https://github.com/autonomousvision/differentiable_volumetric_rendering)
7. [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/)

I also use [Useful tools for the RGB-D benchmark](https://vision.in.tum.de/data/datasets/rgbd-dataset/tools) for evaluation
